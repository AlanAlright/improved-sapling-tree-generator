# improved-sapling-tree-generator
A new version of Blenders sapling tree generator with improvements, new features, and bug fixes

####Change Log
* Rearranged Interface
* Branch spliting now works more predictably
* Back curvature now adds to curvature
* 'Conical' shape is narrower at tip like real conifers
* Curvature variation now bends branches in multiple directions and increases along length of branch
* Auto curve handles is now enabled for branch splits

######New features
* Branch distribution to adjust how the first level is distributed along the height of the tree
* Option to grow branches in rings, like pine trees
* Control of shape of secondary branch split levels
* Minimum branch radius to prevent needle-thin branches, taper removed
* Close tip for branch radius
* Option to make number of splits proportional to branch length
* Root flare to make trunk wider at base
* Leaf rotation can now use negetive values like branches do
