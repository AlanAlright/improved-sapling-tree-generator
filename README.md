# improved-sapling-tree-generator
A new version of Blenders sapling tree generator with improvements, new features, and bug fixes

####Change Log
* Rearranged Interface
* Moved radius settings to a seperate panel
* Branch spliting now works more predictably
* Back curvature now adds to curvature
* 'Conical' shape is narrower at tip like real conifers
* Curvature variation now bends branches in multiple directions and increases along length of branch
* Auto curve handles is now enabled for branch splits
* fixed how child branch start points are calculated
* branch length variation now works in the range 0 - 1 and no longer produces errors

######New features
* Branch distribution to adjust how the first level is distributed along the height of the tree
* Option to grow branches in rings, like pine trees
* Control the shape of secondary branch split levels
* Minimum branch radius to prevent needle-thin branches
* Close tip for branch radius
* Option to make number of splits proportional to branch length
* Root flare to make trunk wider at base
* Leaf rotation can now use negetive values like branches do
* Vertical atraction can now be set individually for each split level
* Experimental 'split bias' for trunk splits to put more splits at top or bottom of tree
* Split start height for longer trunk before splitting
* Outward attraction to make branches point out from the center of the tree
